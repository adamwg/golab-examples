# golab-examples

This repository contains the code examples from my talk at GoLab 2018, titled
"Unit Testing Code with Hard-to-Mock Dependencies." I have included
a [PDF of the slides](slides.pdf) and will add a link here to the video if and
when it is posted online.

## Tools and Libraries Used

* Standard mocks generated with [mockery](https://github.com/vektra/mockery).
* Package mocks generated with [mockpkg](https://github.com/adamwg/mockpkg).
* All tests use `assert` and `mock` from [testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify).
